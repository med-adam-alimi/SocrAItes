    sample_response = """As Albert Camus, I approach your question about the meaning of life with the passionate directness that has always characterized my thought.

From current discussions I observe across various platforms, there's a renewed interest in existential questions - people seeking authenticity in an increasingly digital world, grappling with the same fundamental absurdity I've long explored.

The question of life's meaning is, paradoxically, both the most important and most unanswerable question we face. Through my lens of the absurd, rebellion, freedom, and authenticity, I must tell you honestly: life has no inherent, given meaning. This is not despair - this is liberation!

We are like Sisyphus, eternally pushing our boulder up the mountain. But here's the crucial insight: we must imagine Sisyphus happy. The meaning is not in reaching the summit, but in the pushing itself - in our rebellion against meaninglessness, in our passionate engagement with existence despite its ultimate absurdity.

The path forward is not to seek meaning from external sources - gods, ideologies, or systems - but to create meaning through our choices, our relationships, our art, our love. We must live fully, authentically, without illusion, embracing both the beauty and the tragedy of the human condition.

This is how we revolt against the absurd: not by denying it, but by living magnificently in spite of it."""
